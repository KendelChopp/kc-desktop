# Kendel Circle Desktop Application
## Disclaimer
This code is no bueno. I made this in a day. I am not proud of this, but it works for what I needed it to work for. Check out [the YouTube video about the creation of this here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiXy9zEm8FA).

## Overview
This is the desktop app that you would actually purchase from JackBox. It allows you to create games that people can join.

## Tech Overview
This is a React app that uses electron to run as a desktop app. This may as well be considered a web app, though, as electron is just rendering the web app as its own application.

## How to run
You need Node/npm to use this.

Run `npm run start` to start the website.
Run `npm run es` to start electron and serve the website
